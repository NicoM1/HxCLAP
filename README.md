Haxe port of CLAP, a C++ command line parser:

# Work in progress

My goal with this port is to create a cross-platform solutio that isn't exclusively destined for console programs. For example, it must be able to parse from an input string, not just from Sys.args(). I plan to use for a HaxeFlixel game where I will implement a shell interface.
